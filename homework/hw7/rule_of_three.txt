Rule of Three Clarification

As you know from the course materials, the Rule of Three states that whenever we have a non-trivial destructor, we should also implement a copy constructor and an assignment operator. In this homework, while we do ask you to implement a non-trivial destructor, we are not asking for you to implement the other two aspects.

Given this, please note that in your methods should be passing/receiving pointers or references to trees as opposed to tree objects directly. This is also true in the case of the + operator. While its syntax might suggest that it returns a new object, we expect you to return a reference to the already-existing tree on the left-hand side of the expression.
